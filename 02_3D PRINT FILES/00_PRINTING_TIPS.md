### Printing Tips

* Print in order of the file numbers for optimal assembly.
* All parts are designed to print without supports. Every part has a natural flat side to align to the print bed. 
* Print in colours specified at the end of the filename, e.g. BLK (black), BLU (blue)
* Print QTY of parts denominated by the X number at the start of the filename.
* Filenames starting with OPTIONAL are just that - not necessary for the build but add additional functionality. 

### Print Settings

* Print with 'standard' settings in PLA or PETG for most parts: 0.2mm layer height is fine. 
* Some parts may require more strength, e.g. the 'FOOT' part requires more wall layers (at least 3).
